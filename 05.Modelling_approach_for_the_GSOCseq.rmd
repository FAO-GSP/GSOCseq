# | Modelling approach for the GSOCseq  

## General framework 
SOC sequestration estimates will focus on croplands and grazing lands for the current GSOCseq map version. As defined by IPCC (2006, 2019), croplands include: all annual and perennial crops  (cereals, oils seeds, vegetables, root crops and forages);  perennial crops (including trees and shrubs, orchards, vineyards and plantations such as cocoa, coffee, tea, oil palm, coconut, rubber trees, bananas, and others), and their combination with herbaceous crops (e.g., agroforestry); arable land which is normally used for cultivation of annual crops, but which is temporarily used for forage crops or grazing as part of an annual crop-pasture rotation (mixed system), is to be included under croplands. Grazing lands include different land uses permanently dedicated to livestock production with a predominant herbaceous cover, including intensively managed permanent pastures and hay land, extensively managed grasslands and rangelands, savannahs, and shrublands.
Since the proposed standardized methodology and the defined model are neither parameterized nor recommended for use on organic, sandy, saline, and waterlogged soils, soils with SOC stocks higher than 200 t C ha^-1^, sand contents higher than 90% and/or electrical conductivity higher than 4 dS m-1 at 0-30 cm depth, paddy rice lands, peatlands and wetlands will be masked out from the global results in this first version.
Excluded conditions and land uses can be included in future versions of the GSOCseq map, as harmonized procedures for specific conditions are developed. Countries are nevertheless encouraged to provide supplementary maps developed using preferred alternative SOC models and methodologies, especially for excluded conditions.

## Potential SOC sequestration estimates after the implementation of SSM practices

In order to assess the SOC sequestration potential, SOC stocks in 0-30 cm of mineral soils shall be projected using the RothC model over a 20-year period, under business as usual (BAU) land use and management, and after adoption of SSM practices in croplands and grazing lands (See Chapter 2). A 20-year period is assumed to be the default period during which SOC stocks are approaching a new steady state, to be able to compare results among regions and countries, and with other estimation methods (e.g. IPCC, 2006 Tier 1-2; IPCC, 2019). For some systems, it is acknowledged that the new steady state may take much longer, even more than 100 years, depending on soil and climate characteristics (e.g. Poulton et al, 2018). Together with the 20-years projection, countries can project SOC stocks over 50 or 100 years or more, and determine the stocks and the period at which a new steady state is attained according to local conditions, and produce additional sequestration maps (See mandatory and optional products, Technical Specifications, sections 4.1 and 4.2).
As stated in Chapter 2, SOC sequestration potential after the adoption of SSM practices in current agricultural lands shall be estimated by: an 'absolute SOC sequestration' (SOCseq abs), expressed as the change in SOC stocks over time relative to a base period (or reference period, t0); and a 'relative SOC sequestration' (SOCseq rel), expressed as the change in SOC stocks over time relative to the business as usual scenario. Absolute and relative sequestration and sequestration rates for a 20-year period shall be estimated following the equations described in Chapter 2 (eq. 2.1 and 2.2)

## Business as usual and sustainable soil management scenarios
SOC stocks in 0-30 cm of mineral soils in current agricultural lands shall be projected over a 20-year period, under a business as usual scenario (BAU) and under sustainable soil management (SSM) scenarios. The BAU scenario refers to the land use, land management, production practices or technologies that are currently being implemented (as in time = 0, or 2020) in croplands and grazing lands. BAU practices represent typical, prevailing practices in a specific agro-ecological zone and productive system. SSM practices refer to management practices that are expected to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and retain it as SOC, to enhance SOC accumulation, or to mitigate or reverse SOC losses compared to the BAU (See Fig. 2.1). Although there is no universal soil management practice, basic principles are widely applicable, such as those identified in the Voluntary Guidelines for Sustainable Soil Management (VGSSM; FAO, 2017) for increasing soil carbon inputs to soil and enhancing soil organic matter content:

*   increasing biomass production and residue returns to the soil;
*   using cover crops and/or vegetated fallows;
*   implementing a balanced and integrated soil fertility management scheme; 
*   implementing crop rotations, combining legumes and pulses with high residue crops, or improving the crop-mix;
*   effectively using organic amendments, manure, or other carbon-rich wastes (which are not currently applied to soils);
*   promoting agro-forestry and alley cropping; 
*   managing crop residues and grazing to ensure optimum soil cover; among others.

A very wide range of management practices are currently being implemented and can potentially be introduced into the world's agricultural systems, depending on climatic, soil, socio-cultural and economic conditions. In turn, different SSM C-oriented practices are often combined, making it difficult to dissociate their effects on SOC dynamics. Thus, as a first step, and to harmonize the results on a global map, and because soil carbon turnover models are the most sensitive to carbon inputs (FAO, 2019),  these guidelines propose to group SSM practices into three scenarios as a standard method, based on their expected relative effects on C inputs compared to BAU: Low, Medium and High increase in C inputs (referred as SSM1, SSM2, and SSM3 scenarios; for technical procedures, refer to section 5.4). National experts' opinion and local data are essential to accurately estimate or validate the target areas and carbon input levels for the different SSM scenarios in forthcoming versions.
 
## General modeling procedures
The modeling approach proposed in the current Technical Manual is based on the studies by Smith et al. (2005; 2006; 2007) and Gottschalk et al. (2012). The following sections describe the different modeling phases of the approach. 

### Initialization: Long spin-up
Prior to the simulation of SOC stocks and sequestration under the different scenarios, model initialization is required to set the initial SOC condition (total SOC and partition of the different pools) at the start of the simulation period, and to adjust the C inputs estimates. 
In a first initialization step, RothC shall be run iteratively to equilibrium to calculate the size of the SOC pools and the annual plant carbon inputs using constant environmental conditions (Phase 1, Figure 5.1), for each grid cell on the map. A first equilibrium run for a standard 10,000-year period should be performed, considering constant climatic conditions as the average of historic climate data from 1980 to 2000 (see Chapter 6,  Climate datasets), clay contents (see Chapter 6, soil datasets), and land use as in year 2000 (see Chapter 6, land use datasets). The duration of the equilibrium run can be reduced if the data suggests that the equilibrium is reached with fewer iterations. The total annual plant C input can be initially assumed to be 1 t C ha^-1^ yr^-1^and the proportions of plant material added to the soil for each month are set to describe the typical input pattern for each land use class (Smith et al., 2007; Mondini et al., 2017).
After the first equilibrium run, the annual C input from plant residues needs to be optimized so that the results of the 'long spin-up' fit the estimates of total SOC stocks of 0-30 cm provided in the FAO-ITPS GSOCmap.  C equilibrium inputs can be adjusted using the following equation (Smith et al., 2005):


\begin{equation}
\tag{5.1}
C_{eq}=C_i \times[\frac{SOC_{GSOCmap}-IOM}{(SOC_{sim}-IOM}]                                              
\end{equation}

                                                      
where $C_{eq}$ is the estimated annual C input at equilibrium, $C_i$ is the initial annual  C addition (the sum of the proportions of the C input in the first equilibrium is 1), $SOC_{GSOCmap}$ is the estimated soil C given in FAO-ITPS GSOC map, $SOC_{sim}$ is the simulated soil C after the first equilibrium run, and $IOM$ is the C content of the inert organic matter fraction in the soil (all in t C ha^-1^). The size of the IOM fraction (t C ha^-1^) can be set according to the equation given by Falloon et al. (1998):

\begin{equation}
\tag{5.2}
IOM=0.049 \times SOC_{GSOCmap}^{1.139} 
\end{equation}

A second long term (minimum 1,000 years) equilibrium run shall be performed using the estimated $C_{eq}$, (under the same conditions as the first run), in order to obtain the size of the different SOC pools (t C ha^-1^) at year 2000.

### Short spin-up
Since FAO-ITPS GSOC map SOC was generated from individual SOC measurements taken over different decades (i.e. 1960s to 2000s), a temporal harmonization of SOC stocks can be performed as a second initialization step to minimize differences in current SOC stocks at year 0 (i.e. initial SOC stocks at year 2020), and account for climatic variations in the 2000-2020 period:

*   SOC stocks from the GSOC map shall be considered to be the stocks twenty years prior to the simulation (t = -20 yr; i.e. year 2000).
*   A 20-year 'short spin-up' run can be performed to adjust for major deviations among different measurement periods on the GSOC map (figure 5, Phase 2), using year-to-year climatic conditions for the period 2001-2020 (See Chapter 6, Climate datasets),     clay contents (See Chapter 6, soil datasets), the stocks in the different SOC pools from the results of the 'long spin-up'        run, and land use as in year 2020 (land use representative of the period 2001-2020; or yearly land use data shall be used when    available).
*   Year-to-year C inputs over the period 2001-2020 should be adjusted considering year-to-year changes in estimated Net Primary  Production (NPP), (details in Chapter 6, monthly carbon inputs). SOC stocks can either increase or decrease during this 'short    spin-up' stage. 

This 'short spin-up' period is intended to: reduce the effects of different time measurements in the GSOC map (over- or underestimation of current initial SOC stocks); minimize initialization effects (e.g. deviations in the estimation of initial pool sizes); and account for the effects of sub-regional, regional and global climatic and land use changes over the period 2001-2020 and their effects on NPP. If recent (2015-2020) national SOC monitoring campaigns have been undertaken to generate the latest version of the FAO-IPS GSOC map, the SOC stocks from the GSOCmap can be considered as the current stocks (t = 0 y; i.e. year 2020), and the 'short spin-up' phase is not required.

### Forward runs
After the equilibrium and 'short spin-up' runs, SOC sequestration due to SSM practices can be estimated in a forward run (Figure 5.1, phase 3). SOC stocks can be simulated from 2020 (t=0)  to 2040  (t = +20) for the BAU and the three SSM scenarios, using average mean monthly climate variables (2001-2020), C inputs adjusted as described in Chapter 6 and land use maps from 2020. 
It should be noted that global climatic changes are to be expected over the next 20 years. However, climate change projections diverge significantly in the second half of the century, after the year 2050 (IPCC, 2014; 2018). As there is a lack of consensus over which climate projections to use for future scenarios as well as a significant divergence  in terms of climatic trends after 2050, the use of monthly average climatic variables from 2001-2020 for the period 2020-2040 is set as the standard for the forward run. However, the proposed methodology allows for the integration of climate change scenarios, especially for longer-term projections (i.e. + 2050) in future versions.  
The absolute SOC sequestration is estimated as the difference between the corresponding SOC stocks from the forward modeling at year +20 (2040) for the different scenarios and the estimated baseline SOC stocks for year 0 (year 2020; refer to equation 2.1). The relative SOC sequestration is to be determined as the difference between the corresponding SOC stocks from the forward at year +20 (2040) for the SSM scenarios and the simulated SOC stocks at year +20 (2020) for the BAU scenario (refer to equation 2.2).
