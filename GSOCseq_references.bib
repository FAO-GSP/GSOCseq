 abstract = {Soil organic matter (SOM) represents a major pool of carbon within the biosphere, roughly twice than in atmospheric CO2. SOM models embody our best understanding of soil carbon dynamics and are needed to predict how global environmental change will influence soil carbon stocks. These models are also required for evaluating the likely effectiveness of different mitigation options. The first important step towards systematically evaluating the suitability of SOM models for these purposes is to test their simulations against real data. Since changes in SOM occur slowly, long-term datasets are required. This volume brings together leading SOM model developers and experimentalists to test SOM models using long-term datasets from diverse ecosystems, land uses and climatic zones within the temperate region.},

@article{Poulton.2018,
 abstract = {We evaluated the {\textquotedbl}4 per 1000{\textquotedbl} initiative for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) by analysing rates of SOC increase in treatments in 16 long-term experiments in southeast United Kingdom. The initiative sets a goal for SOC stock to increase by 4‰ per year in the 0-40~cm soil depth, continued over 20~years. Our experiments, on three soil types, provided 114 treatment comparisons over 7-157~years. Treatments included organic additions (incorporated by inversion ploughing), N fertilizers, introducing pasture leys into continuous arable systems, and converting arable land to woodland. In 65{\%} of cases, SOC increases occurred at {\textgreater}7‰ per year in the 0-23~cm depth, approximately equivalent to 4‰ per year in the 0-40~cm depth. In the two longest running experiments ({\textgreater}150~years), annual farmyard manure (FYM) applications at 35~t fresh material per hectare (equivalent to approx. 3.2~t organic C/ha/year) gave SOC increases of 18‰ and 43‰ per year in the 23~cm depth during the first 20~years. Increases exceeding 7‰ per year continued for 40-60~years. In other experiments, with FYM applied at lower rates or not every year, there were increases of 3‰-8‰ per year over several decades. Other treatments gave increases between zero and 19‰ per year over various periods. We conclude that there are severe limitations to achieving the {\textquotedbl}4 per 1000{\textquotedbl} goal in practical agriculture over large areas. The reasons include (1) farmers not having the necessary resources (e.g. insufficient manure); (2) some, though not all, practices favouring SOC already widely adopted; (3) practices uneconomic for farmers-potentially overcome by changes in regulations or subsidies; (4) practices undesirable for global food security. We suggest it is more realistic to promote practices for increasing SOC based on improving soil quality and functioning as small increases can have disproportionately large beneficial impacts, though not necessarily translating into increased crop yield.},

 abstract = {Land-use changes (LUC) influence the balance of soil organic carbon (SOC) and hence may cause CO2 emissions or sequestration. In Europe there is a side by side of LUC types that lead to SOC loss or SOC accumulation. However, there is a lack of studies covering all major LUC types to investigate qualitative and quantitative LUC effects on SOC. In this study we sampled 24 paired sites in Europe to a depth of 80 cm, covering a wide range of pedo-climatic conditions and comprising the major European LUC types cropland to grassland, grassland to cropland, cropland to forest and grassland to forest. To assess qualitative changes and the sensitivity of different functional SOC pools with distinct turnover times, we conducted a fractionation to isolate five different fractions of SOC. The mean SOC stock changes after LUC were 18$\backslash$textpm2.3 Mg ha-1, while all other fractions depleted. Thus, afforestations shift SOC fromstable to labile pools. The resistant fraction comprising the so-called inert carbon was found to be only slightly less sensitive than the total SOC pool, suggesting that an inert carbon pool was not chemically extracted with NaOCl oxidation, if there is any inert carbon},

@article{Plutzar.2016,
 abstract = {Understanding patterns, dynamics, and drivers of land use is crucial for improving our ability to cope with sustainability challenges. The human appropriation of net primary production (HANPP) framework provides a set of integrated socio-ecological indicators that quantify how land use alters energy flows in ecosystems via land conversions and biomass harvest. Thus, HANPP enables researchers to systematically and consistently assess the outcome of changes in land cover and land-use intensity across spatio-temporal scales. Yet, fine-scale HANPP assessments are so far missing, an information important to address site-specific ecological implications of land use. Here, we provide such an assessment for Europe at a 1-km scale for the years 1990, 2000, and 2006. The assessment was based on a consistent land-use/biomass flow dataset derived from statistical data, remote sensing maps, and a dynamic global vegetation model. We find that HANPP in Europe amounted to {\~{}}43~{\%} of potential productivity, well above the global average of {\~{}}25~{\%}, with little variation in the European average since 1990. HANPP was highest in Central Europe and lower in Northern and Southern Europe. At the regional level, distinct changes in land-use intensity were observed, most importantly the decline of cropland areas and yields following the breakdown of socialism in Eastern Europe and the subsequent recovery after 2000, or strong dynamics related to storm events that resulted in massive salvage loggings. In sum, however, these local dynamics cancelled each other out at the aggregate level. We conclude that this finding warrants further research into aspects of the scale-dependency of dynamics and stability of land use.},

 abstract = {The Century soil organic matter model has been used to simulate regional patterns for plant production, soil organic C and N, and soil organic and inorganic P for the U.S. central grassland region. The results show how climatic variables, soil texture and inputs of N control regional patterns of soil organic matter (SOM) and plant production. Variations of soil texture within any one site generated variations in SOM C, N, and P levels. Effects of soil texture included increased stabilization of soil C and N, weathering of parent P, and formation of organic P as the silt plus clay content increased. Simulated soil formation and parent material P weathering for 10,000-year simulation runs suggested that variations in total soil P have little effect on soil C and N levels after 5000 years of soil formation. However, total P levels less than 100 gm-2 caused plant production and soil C and N levels to be reduced because of low P availability during the first 3000 years of soil formation.},

 abstract = {Agricultural plants, covering large parts of the global land surface and important for the livelihoods of people worldwide, fix carbon dioxide seasonally via photosynthesis. The carbon allocation of crops, however, remains relatively understudied compared to, for example, forests. For comprehensive consistent resource assessments or climate change impact studies large-scale reliable vegetation information is needed. Here, we demonstrate how robust data on carbon uptake in croplands can be obtained by combining multiple sources to enhance the reliability of estimates. Using yield statistics, a remote-sensing based productivity algorithm and climate-sensitive potential productivity, we mapped the potential to increase crop productivity and compared consistent carbon uptake information of agricultural land with forests. The productivity gap in Europe is higher in Eastern and Southern than in Central-Western countries. At continental scale, European agriculture shows a greater carbon uptake in harvestable compartments than forests (agriculture 1.96 vs. forests 1.76 t C ha-1 year-1). Mapping productivity gaps allows efforts to enhance crop production to be prioritized by, for example, improved crop cultivars, nutrient management or pest control. The concepts and methods for quantifying carbon uptake used in this study are applicable worldwide and allow forests and agriculture to be included in future carbon uptake assessments.},

@article{Morais.2019,
 abstract = {Assessments of the global carbon (C) cycle typically rely on simplified models which consider large areas as homogeneous in terms of the response of soils to land use or consider very broad land classes. For example, {\textquotedbl}cropland{\textquotedbl} is typically modelled as an aggregation of distinct practices and individual crops over large regions. Here, we use the process-based Rothamsted soil Carbon Model (RothC model), which has a history of being successfully applied at a global scale, to calculate attainable SOC stocks and C mineralization rates for each of c. 17,000 regions (combination of soil type and texture, climate type, initial land use and country) in the World, under near-past climate conditions. We considered 28 individual crops and, for each, multiple production practices, plus 16 forest types and 1 grassland class (total of 80 classes). We find that conversion to cropland can result in SOC increases, particularly when the soil remains covered with crop residues (an average gain of 12 t C/ha) or using irrigation (4 t C/ha), which are mutually reinforcing effects. Attainable SOC stocks vary significantly depending on the land use class, particularly for cropland. Common aggregations in global modelling of a single agricultural class would be inaccurate representations of these results. Attainable SOC stocks obtained here were compared to long-term experiment data and are well aligned with the literature. Our results provide a regional and detailed understanding of C sequestration that will also enable better greenhouse gas reporting at national level as alternatives to IPCC tier 2 defaults.},

 abstract = {Climate change and stagnating crop yields may cause a decline of SOC stocks in agricultural soils leading to considerable CO2 emissions and reduced agricultural productivity. Regional model-based SOC projections are needed to evaluate these potential risks. In this study, we simulated the future SOC development in cropland and grassland soils of Bavaria in the 21(st) century. Soils from 51 study sites representing the most important soil classes of Central Europe were fractionated and derived SOC pools were used to initialize the RothC soil carbon model. For each site, long-term C inputs were determined using the C allocation method. Model runs were performed for three different C input scenarios as a realistic range of projected yield development. Our modelling approach revealed substantial SOC decreases of 11-16{\%} under an expected mean temperature increase of 3.3 °C assuming unchanged C inputs. For the scenario of 20{\%} reduced C inputs, agricultural SOC stocks are projected to decline by 19-24{\%}. Remarkably, even the optimistic scenario of 20{\%} increased C inputs led to SOC decreases of 3-8{\%}. Projected SOC changes largely differed among investigated soil classes. Our results indicated that C inputs have to increase by 29{\%} to maintain present SOC stocks in agricultural soils.},

 abstract = {There is growing international interest in better managing soils to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) content to contribute to climate change mitigation, to enhance resilience to climate change and to underpin food security, through initiatives such as international '4p1000' initiative and the FAO's Global assessment of SOC sequestration potential (GSOCseq) programme. Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils.},

 abstract = {Agricultural lands occupy 37{\%} of the earth's land surface. Agriculture accounts for 52 and 84{\%} of global anthropogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agricultural soils may also act as a sink or source for CO2, but the net flux is small. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the most prominent of which are improved cropland and grazing land management and restoration of degraded lands and cultivated organic soils. Lower, but still significant mitigation potential is provided by water and rice management, set-aside, land use change and agroforestry, livestock management and manure management. The global technical mitigation potential from agriculture (excluding fossil fuel offsets from biomass) by 2030, considering all gases, is estimated to be approximately 5500-6000Mt CO2-eq.yr-1, with economic potentials of approximately 1500-1600, 2500-2700 and 4000-4300Mt CO2-eq.yr-1 at carbon prices of up to 20, up to 50 and up to 100 US{\$} t CO2-eq.-1, respectively. In addition, GHG emissions could be reduced by substitution of fossil fuels for energy production by agricultural feedstocks (e.g. crop residues, dung and dedicated energy crops). The economic mitigation potential of biomass energy from agriculture is estimated to be 640, 2240 and 16 000Mt CO2-eq.yr-1 at 0-20, 0-50 and 0-100 US{\$} t CO2-eq.-1, respectively.},

 abstract = {Bottom-up estimates from long-term field experiments and modelling are the most commonly used approaches to estimate the carbon (C) sequestration potential of the agricultural sector. However, when data are required at European level, important margins of uncertainty still exist due to the representativeness of local data at large scale or different assumptions and information utilized for running models. In this context, a pan-European (EU + Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, Albania, Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Norway) simulation platform with high spatial resolution and harmonized data sets was developed to provide consistent scenarios in support of possible carbon sequestration policies. Using the CENTURY agroecosystem model, six alternative management practices (AMP) scenarios were assessed as alternatives to the business as usual situation (BAU). These consisted of the conversion of arable land to grassland (and vice versa), straw incorporation, reduced tillage, straw incorporation combined with reduced tillage, ley cropping system and cover crops. The conversion into grassland showed the highest soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration rates, ranging between 0.4 and 0.8 t C~ha(-1) ~yr(-1) , while the opposite extreme scenario (100{\%} of grassland conversion into arable) gave cumulated losses of up to 2 Gt of C by 2100. Among the other practices, ley cropping systems and cover crops gave better performances than straw incorporation and reduced tillage. The allocation of 12 to 28{\%} of the European arable land to different AMP combinations resulted in a potential SOC sequestration of 101-336 Mt CO2 eq. by 2020 and 549-2141 Mt CO2 eq. by 2100. Modelled carbon sequestration rates compared with values from an ad hoc meta-analysis confirmed the robustness of these estimates.},

 abstract = {The period since World War II, and especially the last decade influenced by the International Biological Program, has seen enormous growth in research on the function of ecosystems. The same period has seen an exponential' rise in environmental problems including the capacity of the Earth to support man's population. The concern extends to man's effects on the {\textquotedbl}biosphere{\textquotedbl}--The film of living organisms on the Earth's surface that supports man. The common theme of ecologic research and environmental concerns is primary productionƯ the binding of sunlight energy into organic matter by plants that supports all life. Many results from the IBP remain to be synthesized, but enough data are available from that program and other research to develop a convincing sumƯ mary of the primary production of the biosphere-the purpose of this book. The book had its origin in the parallel interests of the two editors and Gene E. Likens, which led them to prepare a symposium on the topic at the Second Biological Congress of the American Institute of Biological Sciences in Miami, Florida, October 24, 1971. Revisions of the papers presented at that symposium appear as Chapters 2, 8, 9, 10, and 15 in this book. We have added other chapters that complement this core; these include discussion and evaluation of methods for measuring productivity and regional production, current findings on tropical productivity, and models of primary productivity.},

It uses a monthly time step to calculate total organic carbon (t C ha-1), microbial biomass carbon (t C ha-1) and \textgreek{D}14C (from which the radiocarbon age of the soil can be calculated) on a years-to-centuries timescale (Jenkinson, 1990; Jenkinson and Coleman, 1994; Jenkinson et al., 1987; Jenkinson et al., 1991; Jenkinson et al., 1992). It needs few inputs and those it needs are easily obtainable. It is an extension of the earlier model described by Jenkinson and Rayner (1977), and by Hart (1984). Needless to say, it has many ideas in common with other contemporary turnover models, notably CENTURY (Parton et al., 1988) and Van Veen and Paul's model (Van Veen and Paul, 1981).},

@book{Beek.1973,
 abstract = {The problem: In the majority of soils most of the nitrogen is in organic compounds and only a small percentage is present in inorganic compounds. Depending on the type of decomposition process of the organic matter, organic nitrogen is mineralized into ammonia or inorganic nitrogen is immobilized by transforming it into organic nitrogen. The inorganic soil nitrogen is mainly present in the form of nitrate and ammonia. Ammonia may be transformed to nitrate by nitrification while nitrate may be transformed to volatile nitrogen compounds. All these processes are carried out by soil micro-organisms and consequently are influenced by temperature, moisture, pH and aeration of the soil. Since both the turnover rate between the organic, ammonium, nitrate and elementary form of nitrogen is very high and the influence of external factors like temperature and precipitation considerable, it is hardly possible to estimate the inorganic nitrogen available for plants during a growth season, on the basis of chemical and physical experiments at one certain moment. An alternative approach of attaining a reliable estimate would be to use the information available in literature about the separate microbial processes. Then the problem is to integrate the knowledge about the separate processes into a larger model where all the involved processes are acting simultaneously. A unique opportunity to solve this problem is provided by the modem digital computer simulation techniques. The `Continuous System Modeling Program' (CSMP/ 360), developed for the IBM 360 series of machines, has proved t be very suitable to simulate biological processes. Information about CSMP is given in the `User's manual of the system / 360 Continuous System Modeling Program'...},

 abstract = {The development of the CANDY system (CArbon and Nitrogen DYnamics) has been based on experience of organic matter turnover and nitrogen dynamics gained over a long period, a major part of the scientific work in Bad Lauchst{\"a}dt. The main objective in developing the model was to give farmers a tool for calculating short term dynamics of nitrogen transformations and long term changes in the carbon content of the soil. For this reason the system consists of a database interface and several model components. The main component is the CANDY module, written in TURBO - PASCAL which calculates daily changes of water, temperature, carbon and nitrogen for a 2 m deep soil profile. Alongside this daily-timestep nitrogen simulation, there is a long term carbon module that calculates the amount of decomposable carbon in steady state for a given crop rotation. The calculation is specific to the site and management practices and is based on averaged turnover conditions, yields and inputs of organic material.},

The correlation between the productivity and character of vegetation cover, and the potential for agriculture and the environmental aspects of cultural development, have created additional interest. This volume emphasizes the fact that assessment of primary productivity is a time-consuming and expensive procedure. In some cases, it is even logistically impossible to measure the current productivity rate directly. Under such circumstances, one is inclined to look for indirect ways to estimate the productive capacity of any given region. The most feasible approach to the task is the elaboration of models that predict productivity from environmental parameters that have been measured in a reasonably dense network over the world.},

The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15{\%} of the global fossil-fuel emissions.},

@article{Keenan.2011,
 abstract = {Model-data fusion is a powerful framework by which to combine models with various data streams (including observations at different spatial or temporal scales), and account for associated uncertainties. The approach can be used to constrain estimates of model states, rate constants, and driver sensitivities. The number of applications of model-data fusion in environmental biology and ecology has been rising steadily, offering insights into both model and data strengths and limitations. For reliable model-data fusion-based results, however, the approach taken must fully account for both model and data uncertainties in a statistically rigorous and transparent manner. Here we review and outline the cornerstones of a rigorous model-data fusion approach, highlighting the importance of properly accounting for uncertainty. We conclude by suggesting a code of best practices, which should serve to guide future efforts.},

@article{Hengl.2017,
 abstract = {This paper describes the technical development and accuracy assessment of the most recent and improved version of the SoilGrids system at 250m resolution (June 2016 update). SoilGrids provides global predictions for standard numeric soil properties (organic carbon, bulk density, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), pH, soil texture fractions and coarse fragments) at seven standard depths (0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 100 and 200 cm), in addition to predictions of depth to bedrock and distribution of soil classes based on the World Reference Base (WRB) and USDA classification systems (ca. 280 raster layers in total). Predictions were based on ca. 150,000 soil profiles used for training and a stack of 158 remote sensing-based soil covariates (primarily derived from MODIS land products, SRTM DEM derivatives, climatic images and global landform and lithology maps), which were used to fit an ensemble of machine learning methods-random forest and gradient boosting and/or multinomial logistic regression-as implemented in the R packages ranger, xgboost, nnet and caret. The results of 10-fold cross-validation show that the ensemble models explain between 56{\%} (coarse fragments) and 83{\%} (pH) of variation with an overall average of 61{\%}. Improvements in the relative accuracy considering the amount of variation explained, in comparison to the previous version of SoilGrids at 1 km spatial resolution, range from 60 to 230{\%}. Improvements can be attributed to: (1) the use of machine learning instead of linear regression, (2) to considerable investments in preparing finer resolution covariate layers and (3) to insertion of additional soil profiles. Further development of SoilGrids could include refinement of methods to incorporate input uncertainties and derivation of posterior probability distributions (per pixel), and further automation of spatial modeling so that soil maps can be generated for potentially hundreds of soil variables. Another area of future research is the development of methods for multiscale merging of SoilGrids predictions with local and/or national gridded soil products (e.g. up to 50 m spatial resolution) so that increasingly more accurate, complete and consistent global soil information can be produced. SoilGrids are available under the Open Data Base License.},

@article{Hansen.1991,
 abstract = {A dynamic simulation model for the soil plant system is described. The model includes a number of main modules, viz., a hydrological model including a submodel for soil water dynamics, a soil temperature model, a soil nitrogen model including a submodel for soil organic matter dynamics, and a crop model including a submodel for nitrogen uptake. The soil part of the model has a one-dimensional vertical structure. The soil profile is divided into layers on the basis of physical and chemical soil characteristics. The simulation model was used to simulate soil nitrogen dynamics and biomass production in winter wheat grown at two locations at various levels of nitrogen fertilization. The simulated results were compared to experimental data including concentration of inorganic nitrogen in soil, crop yield, and nitrogen accumulated in the aboveground part of the crop. Based on this validation it is concluded that the overall performance of the model is satisfactory although some minor adjustments of the model may prove to be necessary.},
